  Description:
    Abstract: This ArcView shapefile represents the internal boundaries of the United States and the political boundaries between the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
    Purpose: This data layer includes the internal boundaries for the United States and the political boundaries of the U.S., Canada and Mexico.  The state boundaries are drawn to the U.S. coastline and does not include any coastline or islands.  This data layer may be used with the high resolution NOS80K coastline (allus80k.shp) which does not include any internal boundaries.
    Supplemental_Information: This dataset was created to be used with the NOS80K coastline (allus80k.shp) to provide state bounds without redrawing the coastline.  In creating the data layer, some issues of the NOS80K coastline became apparent.  One example, is the US/Mexico boundary.  The NOS80K coastline closes and draws a straight line well below the Texas border.  The same type of problem can be seen around the U.S./Canada boundary of the Great Lakes.  The state_bounds.shp will draw the political boundaries while the allus80k.shp file will display the U.S. beyond the political boundaries.  If this is unacceptable to the user, they should consider masking the annexed U.S. possession.

      Source_Contribution: The compiled usa.shp file was used as the source for this new data layer.
    Process_Step:
      Process_Description: The usa.shp file was copied and edited to remove the coastline and islands.  Because the file contained shapes for the individual states, duplicate common boundaries were numerous.  The file was edited further to remove these duplicate shapes and remove the original table information.  A final clean-up was done to combine (UNION) line segments and reduce the number of individual shapes.
